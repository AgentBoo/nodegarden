# HTML5 Node Garden

https://pakastin.github.io/nodegarden

Really simple node garden made with HTML5. No Barnes-Hut n-body optimization, just [simple physics](https://github.com/pakastin/nodegarden/blob/master/scripts/index.js#L102).

"Rules":
- Circles represent nodes
- Node's mass is proportional to it's size
- Lines are the gravitational force between nodes
- Line opacity tells the strength of force
- When two nodes collide, smaller one will reset to a new location and size
- When node travels over screen limits it will reset to a new location and size
