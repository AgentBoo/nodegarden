# HTML5 Node Garden

https://nodegarden.js.org

Really simple node garden made with HTML5. No Barnes-Hut n-body optimization, just simple physics.

- Click to add nodes
- Drag to make mouse a "black hole"


- Circles represent nodes
- Node's mass is proportional to it's size
- Lines visualize the gravitational force between nodes
- Line opacity equals to the strength of force
- When two nodes collide, smaller one will reset to a new location and size
- When node travels over screen limits it will reset to a new location and size

Alternate version (with electrons & positrons instead of "planets"):

- red lines visualize attraction force
- blue lines visualize repel force
